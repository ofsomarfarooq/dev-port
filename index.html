            <h1><span class="name">Hero Alom</span> the Unstoppable Legend</h1>
            <h3>World Class meme material</h3>
            <p>I'm an actor.I'm a singer.I'm a Politician.I'm a hero.I can do anything for entertainment.You might saw
                me in
                various meme templates.It was a time when my meme templates had been very popular all over
                Asia(Specially in
                South Asia).My memes used to be very funny when these were very popular.Basically, my meme templates had
                come from my self made music videos where I always acted on the hero character.In those videos<span
                    id="dots">...</span><span id="more">I was not suited as a hero character which makes meself funny
                    and
                    also viral in all over the internet.And most of my memes had came from my own creation where I
                    always
                    took myself as a hero.Not only that I named myself as <span class="name">Hero Alom</span>. Thats how
                    a
                    Ultra Legend has born. But no one paid me for my memes.Then I joined in the real media. </span> </p>
