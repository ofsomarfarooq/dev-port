                    and
                    also viral in all over the internet.And most of my memes had came from my own creation where I
                    always
                    took myself as a hero.Not only that I named myself as <span class="name">Hero Alom</span>. Thats how

                <p>In 2018 Alom decided to contest in 2018 Bangladeshi general election and he bought his candidature
                    form
                    for Bogra-4 constituency buying a Jatiya Party (E) nomination paper ahead of the 11th national
                    elections,[12] but Jatiya Party denied him nomination. Later, he sought his candidacy as an
                    independent<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                        candidate.[13] On 10 December High Court instructed Bangladesh Election Commission to accept his
                        candidature form as the latter authority denied his candidature earlier and Alom contested in
                        the
                        election as an independent candidate.[14][15] His candidacy drew so much media attention that,
                        in
                        2018,
                        he became the 2nd Bangladeshi only behind Khaleda Zia to be in the top 10 in the category of

                        638
                        votes in his name and BNP candidate Mosharraf Hossain won the seat of that constituency</span>
